# Twin grain identification in nanocrystalline specimens

The objective is to identify fcc atoms with twin misorientation with respect to a reference orientation

**grain_segmentation_analysis:**

This module uses the Grain segmentation modifier implemented in OVITO open-source visualization software to partition atoms in a nanocrystal into groups with similar lattice orientation. The Grain ID is appended to the particles properties and the grain orientation is noted in a custom GrainSegmentationAnalysis output file.
